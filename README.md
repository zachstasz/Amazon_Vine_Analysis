# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview

Analyzing the Amazon Vine Program, we are seeing if the program has any bias and whether or not it produces more 5 star reviews than non-Vine reviews. I've chosen the reviews of DVDs as my sample set.

## Results
- There were 49 Vine reviews as opposed to 151,362 non-Vine reviews.

- There were 9 Vine reviews that were 5 stars. Non-Vine reviews for 5 stars totaled at 78,034.

## Summary

In summary, I do not believe there is any positive bias for the reviews in the Vine program. Since only 18.37% of Vine reviews were 5 stars, as opposed to a staggering 51.55% of non-Vine 5 star reviews, people are not giving out as many 5 star reviews in the Vine program. This would suggest that reviewers in the Vine program are much more critical of the product.

Additional analysis could be done to further refine the data. Verified Purchase could be taken into account to see how many of the non-Vine 5 star reviews were actually purchased by the reviewer. We could also run this analysis on all of the products and aggregate all the data as opposed to just DVDs.
